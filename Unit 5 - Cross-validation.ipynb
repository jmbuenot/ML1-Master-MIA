    "# Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the code developed so far, it is possible to train an ANN and provide an estimate of the results it would offer in its real execution (with unseen patterns, represented by a test set). However, in this last aspect there are two factors to consider, as a consequence of the non-deterministic nature of the process we are following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The partitioning of the set of patterns into training/test is random (hold out), and is therefore overly dependent on good or bad luck in choosing training and test patterns.\n",
    "- ANN training is not deterministic, as the initialisation of the weights is random. As before, it is too dependent on good or bad luck to start the training at a good or bad starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these two reasons, the test result of a single training is not significant when assessing the goodness of fit of the model in the presence of unseen patterns. To solve this problem, the experiment is repeated several times and the results are averaged. This can be implemented in a simple way by means of a loop; however, it is necessary to do this in an orderly way as there are two different sources of randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, to minimise the randomness due to the partitioning of the data set, it is necessary to have a method that ensures that each data is used for training at least once, and for testing at least once. The most commonly used method is cross-validation. In this method, the data set is split into k disjoint subsets and k experiments are performed. In the k-th experiment, the k subset is separated for testing, and the remaining k-1 substes are used for training, performing a k-fold cross-validation. A common value is k=10, which gives a 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, the test value corresponding to the appropriate metric will be the average value of the values of the k experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used variant of cross-validation is stratified cross-validation. In this case, each subset is created in such a way as to keep the proportion of patterns of each class the same (or similar) as in the original dataset. This is particularly used when the data set is imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usual to save not only the mean, but also the k values, in order to subsequently perform a paired hypothesis test with another model. To do this, it is necessary that both models have been trained using the same training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of evaluating the model is often considered to be slightly pessimistic, i.e. the results obtained in tests are slightly worse than those that would be obtained from real training with all available data. In a hold out experiment, as mentioned above, several data are separated for testing. This means that the model is trained with less data than is available, and that by chance the data separated for testing can be of great importance (especially if there is little data). For this reason, when training with less data and possibly no \"important\" data, hold out is considered a pessimistic assessment. In the same way, cross-validation also separates data for testing, so it does not train on all available data, and is therefore also pessimistic. However, it is guaranteed that all data are used at least once in training and once in testing, thus trying to minimise the impact of chance in separating data, so it is considered only a slightly pessimistic evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this is as simple as splitting the data set and performing a loop with k iterations in which at the k-th iteration a model is trained and evaluated with the corresponding sets. However, if the model is not deterministic, the result obtained at the k-th iteration will not be meaningful, since it is again dependent on chance. In this case, what needs to be done is a second nested loop within iteration k in which the model is repeatedly trained, and finally an average of the results is made to finally output the result of iteration k. The number of trainings must be high for the average results to be really significant, at least 50 trainings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5.1\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❓ If this second loop is performed with a deterministic model, what will be the standard deviation of the test results obtained? Is there a difference between performing this second loop and averaging the results, or doing a single training?"

    "In this way, it is possible to evaluate a model together with its hyperparameters in solving a problem. A very common situation is to compare several models (or the same model with different hyperparameters), for which this scheme has to be applied with an important caveat: the sets used in the cross-validation must be the same for each model. Since the distribution of patterns in different sets is random, having the same subsets in different runs is achieved by setting the random seed at the beginning of the program to be executed. Setting the random seed not only allows the same subsets to be generated, but is also important in order to be able to repeat the results in different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to bear in mind that this methodology allows estimating the real performance of a model (although slightly pessimistic). The final model that would be used in production would be the result of training it with all the available patterns, since, as seen in the theory class, and very generally speaking, the more patterns you train with, the better the model will be.\n",

    "- For each fold, a **confusion matrix is computed for every execution**.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This global confusion matrix **does not represent the result of any single model**.  \n",
    "  Therefore, calling it a \"confusion matrix\" can be misleading — but it is still useful to analyze how instances are distributed in the test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the same reason, the **metrics derived from this matrix** will generally **not match** the metric values returned by the function (which are averages of the metric scores for each fold).  \n",
    "  These matrices are meant to provide **a visual and aggregated summary**, while the true evaluation metrics are the ones computed per fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a result of averaging the confusion matrices, the **final confusion matrix will contain real numbers**, not integers.  \n",
    "  While this is technically not correct, it is acceptable to include it in a report — as long as the nature of the matrix is clearly explained.\n",

    "1. Develop a function called `crossvalidation` that receives a value `N` (equal to the number of patterns), and a value `k` (number of subsets into which the dataset is to be split), and returns a vector of length N, where each element indicates in which subset that pattern should be included.\n",
